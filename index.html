    <p><b>9/2/2022:</b></p>This week we learned about mechanical engineering and what fields of specialty there is in mechanical engineering. We started getting familiar with the tinkercad website. As a "friday challange"we had to choose a kitchen appliance and make it through tinkercad. I chose a mirowave and although I had fun, it was hard to get used to the webste. </p>
    <p><b>9/16/2022:</b></p> This week we were working on our Rube Goldberg CAD as well as the physical building of it. Our challenge today was to build a paper boat that would hold a certain amount of weight. We had a boat paper boat that had two long pieces on the side. After a minute the boat sank. We came to the conculsion that the surface area is what mattered in keepint the boat afloat.This challenge was very fun and I enjoyed seeing everyone's designes.
    <p><b>9/22/2022</b></p>This week we workded on physically building our Rube Goldberg designes. We were set on our design and it took us about 2 class periods to build it. On Friday we finally got to test out our machine. We tried a few times but for some reason the balloon wasn't popping. After making some adjustments we tried again. However, it still didn't work. We had one more idea and that was changing the needle. We guessed that maybe the needle wasn't sharp enough, which was why the balloon wasnt popping. Finally, it worked. We spent the rest of the period on friday just finishing up our CAD as well as updating our websites.

    <p><b>9/30/2022</b></p> We started off this week working on disecting a laptop computer. We used multiple sizes of screwdrivers and collected all the pieces. We were able to find the motherboard, CPU, RAM, Hard Drive, WiFi Module, Fan, Heat Sink, Disk Drive, Audio, and Battery. This was a very interesting lab because I was able to learn how a computer actually works and what components need to be part of it in order for the computer to function properly. Hopefully next week we will be able to do something that includes the same topic, so I can learn more. Lastly, we had a guest speaker who taught us how computers are programed and the basic parts of computers, which I really enjoyed.
