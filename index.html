    <p><b>9/2/2022:</b></p>This week we learned about mechanical engineering and what fields of specialty there is in mechanical engineering. We started getting familiar with the tinkercad website. As a "friday challange"we had to choose a kitchen appliance and make it through tinkercad. I chose a mirowave and although I had fun, it was hard to get used to the webste. </p>
    <p><b>9/16/2022:</b></p> This week we were working on our Rube Goldberg CAD as well as the physical building of it. Our challenge today was to build a paper boat that would hold a certain amount of weight. We had a boat paper boat that had two long pieces on the side. After a minute the boat sank. We came to the conculsion that the surface area is what mattered in keepint the boat afloat.This challenge was very fun and I enjoyed seeing everyone's designes.
